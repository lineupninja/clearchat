        <p>
            If you're hosting a public video chat then it can attract unwanted attention from troublemakers.<br>
            ClearChat helps you screen your guests by chatting with them <em>before</em> you let them into your chat, meeting or event.
        </p>

        <p>How it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sign up for your free room below.</li>
            <li>Guests connect and introduce themselves, no accounts or passwords required.</li>
            <li>Chat with the guest to verify them.</li>
            <li>ClearChat shares the details for your chat with the ones you trust.</li>
        </ol>
